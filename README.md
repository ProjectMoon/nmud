Game Objects
============
Game objects (mobiles, rooms, items, etc) are composed of *traits* and
*prototypes*. Traits and prototypes add methods and properties to the objects 
they are mixed into. The differentiation between a trait and prototype is
entirely logical; traits are more akin to interfaces that add common meta
functionality to an object, while a prototype is supposed to define what
the object *is*.

Another way to look at it is that traits define what an object is in metagame
terms, while a prototype defines what the object is in game terms.

Examples:

* A room has the `Container` trait and the `Room` prototype.
* A player has the `Player` trait and `Mobile` prototype.
* A weapon might have the `Item` and `Weapon` prototypes.

Traits
------
The current list of traits is:

* `Container`: Signifies that this object can store other objects inside it.
  This is more generic than a container in the literal sense. A Container can
  store ANY mud object, such as mobiles, items, or entities.
  
  Properties & Methods: 
    * `canStore(mudObj)`: Determines what the Container can store. Override to
    limit what types of objects can be stored. By default, stores everything.
    * `add(mudObj)`: Adds a mud object to this Container.
    * `remove(mudObjOrMemID)`: Removes a mud object by memory ID or by object
      reference.
    * `find(name)`: Finds a mud object in the container by name (e.g. "sword").
    
* `Player(socket)`: The Player trait allows the object to be under a player's
   control. This trait adds properties and events that connect the player object
   to a socket so the player can control it. The socket is optional. If it is
   not passed in, the object will be divorced from any remote connection.
  
  Properties & Methods:
    * `socket`: The currently connected socket. Will be null if there is no
       socket.
    * `send(data)`: Sends some data to the other end of the player's socket.
    * `command(text)`: Execute a command as if it were received from the socket.

  Events:
    * `command(data)`: Fired when a command is executed. `data` is the command
      text.
    * `move(oldRoom, newRoom)`: Fired when the player moves from one room to
       another.
    
Prototypes
----------
The current list of prototypes is:

* `Mobile`: Signifies that this object is a mobile. Mobiles encompass both PCs
  and NPCs usually. A player will be a mobile with a class, leveling, and other
  stats. An NPC will be a mobile with AI and other things.
  
  Properties & Methods:
    * `commandContext`: A dynamic property that always returns a context for
      command execution. Do not override.
    * `name`: The name of the mobile. Will be displayed to other occupants of a
      room.
    * `room`: The current room the mobile is in.
    * `move(newRoom)`: Move to a new room.
    
* `Room`: A Room is an object that has a title, description, and exits that link
  it to other Rooms. Rooms are also usually Containers, so they can have mobiles
  and items and entities inside them.
  
  Properties & Methods:
    * `north`: The north exit.
    * `south`: The south exit.
    * `east`: The east exit.
    * `west`: The west exit.
    * `up`: The up exit.
    * `down`: The down exit.
    
  Events:
    * `enter(obj)`: Fired when a mud object enters the room via movement.
    * `exit(obj)`: Fired when a mud object leaves the room via movement.
